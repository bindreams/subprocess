//! Process-tree containment. Spawn a child as a kill-group root and tear the
//! whole tree down as a unit. Mechanisms, strongest first, all *best-effort in
//! their own way* (the variant names the teardown method, not a quality grade):
//!
//! - [`Containment::CgroupV2`] (Linux): leaf cgroup + `cgroup.kill` — fork-proof.
//! - [`Containment::JobObject`] (Windows): Job + `KILL_ON_JOB_CLOSE`.
//! - [`Containment::ProcessGroup`]/[`Containment::Session`] (Unix): `killpg`.
//! - [`Containment::TreeWalk`] (all): identity-aware descendant kill at teardown.
//! - [`Containment::Delegated`]: a nested member — the outermost root tears it down.
//! - [`Containment::None`]: not contained — lone-process semantics.
//!
//! This is NOT a security sandbox: a determined child escapes every mechanism
//! (broker-spawned helpers, privilege, `setsid` out of a process group). It
//! reliably tears down *cooperative* trees and reports the achieved guarantee.
