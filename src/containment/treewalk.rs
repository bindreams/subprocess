//! Identity-aware process-tree teardown — the cross-platform mechanism, used
//! both when requested directly (`ContainMode::TreeWalk`) and as the terminal
//! fallback of `ContainMode::Strongest` (e.g. a Windows job-assign failure, or a
//! host with no kernel container).
//!
//! Unlike a kernel container, this mechanism has no enforced membership: at
//! teardown it takes a `(pid, ppid)` snapshot of the host, walks the ppid chain
//! down from the root, and kills each *genuine* descendant by identity. It is
//! best-effort and reports as [`crate::containment::Containment::TreeWalk`]: it
//! misses reparented orphans (a child whose parent already exited, so its ppid no
//! longer chains to the root) and broker-spawned escapes.
//!
//! # The PID-reuse / stale-ppid defense (the token-order rule)
//!
//! A `(pid, ppid)` snapshot is racy: a candidate's `pid` may have been recycled,
//! or its `ppid` may name a *recycled* root pid. So a chained ppid alone does not
//! prove descent. We additionally require the candidate's high-res start token
//! (Linux jiffies / Windows 100 ns FILETIME / macOS µs) to order correctly
//! against the root's: a genuine descendant was created at-or-after the root
//! acquired its pid. The keep predicate is
//!
//! ```text
//! token > root.token || (allow_equal && token == root.token)
//! ```
//!
//! `allow_equal` is a per-OS `cfg` const ([`ALLOW_EQUAL_TOKEN`]): `true` on
//! Linux/macOS, `false` on Windows. Why per-OS:
//!
//! - An impostor — a *stale ppid* pointing at a *recycled* root pid — is always a
//!   process created *before* the root (token **<** root.token), so it is
//!   excluded by both rules. This is the case the token guard exists to defend.
//! - A `token == root.token` candidate whose current ppid == root.pid can only be
//!   a *genuine* same-tick child: an unrelated same-tick collision that also
//!   happens to carry a recycled ppid equal to root.pid is impossible.
//! - **Linux/macOS** reparent orphans to pid 1 / launchd, so a process whose ppid
//!   still equals root.pid genuinely descends from it — ppid is *authoritative*.
//!   `>=` is therefore safe AND catches same-jiffy immediate children that strict
//!   `>` would silently miss under Linux's coarse 10 ms jiffy clock (this also
//!   makes the live integration test deterministic).
//! - **Windows** does not reparent and recycles pids freely, so we keep strict
//!   `>`. Its 100 ns FILETIME clock makes a same-tick *genuine* child
//!   indistinguishable from impossible, so strict `>` loses nothing there.
